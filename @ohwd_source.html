You will laugh... I pitched this to my neighbour. 4 years ago. She never acted on it. Her loss.

I am one of those people that always has many new and crazy ideas, but not enough knowledge to act on all of them.

I started 6 years ago. Really below up the last two years. If she could code she missed out! Itâ€™s my custom coding that attracts people to me because theyâ€™re all sick of Wordpress and cheap overseas devs. Itâ€™s still not too late!

Hopefully not everyone is tied of Wordpress. It does give them a nice place to easily make text edits. I see the appeal to custom coded sites though.

Oh it has its purposes and benefits. What ends up happening is they set it up themselves or had a cheap dev on fiver do it and after a while itâ€™s just not showing up in search results or getting calls or emails from it and they donâ€™t know why. Thatâ€™s when youâ€™ve grown out of your basic DIY site and to get more out of it you need someone who knows WHY itâ€™s not working, how to fix it, and actually do it. Thatâ€™s usually the point when people come find me or get referred to me. Theyâ€™re too busy to manage it themselves anymore and are happy to just unload it to someone else to deal with.

She went into branding in the end. She can code a bit. I am just a script kiddie. I can install php scripts, templates, but lack the coding side. I do good in transportation, so I am sticking to what works for now.

Congratulations!

Thanks! ðŸ¤™ itâ€™s nice not having to sell sell sell every month and pay bills. Create some consistency I can rely on and build up. Makes supporting a whole family on a single income work when running a business like this. Iâ€™m going for $34k a month by the end of the year. Itâ€™s hard freakin work. Gotta sell 10 sites a month every month to get it. So far so good!

Hi, I love business models based off of SAAS but you have me very curious, here. I used to be a Web Developer and Designer so asking for my own insight. Is the purpose of this to get customers in the door because this is a bit too good of a deal from my perspective and a shtload of work especially if you get a challenging customer where â€˜scopecreepâ€™ keeps happening. Hoping to hear more about thinking behind this. Are you getting help from folks on Upwork?

I donâ€™t use Upwork. I have developers in the Uk, Australia, Canada, US, and France. Not cheap people. It work gets done while I sleep. The purpose is to make recurring residual monthly income thatâ€™s stable and reliable and scalable. If I sold lump sum sites then in order to scale I have to sell more sites. With subscription I can sell the same amount of websites a month every month and actually grow my income more and more every month. Itâ€™s the best way to scale a web agency.

The key is optimizing the workflow so I can get websiteâ€™s designed and built within 10 hours and still be hand coded and high quality. I figured out how to do it and built tools and processes that allows me and my team to do it. I eat the costs for a few months and after some time Iâ€™m profitable. Ideally a client stays 5 years to make it worth it.

Nope. I donâ€™t have time to learn how other platforms work and they will take us more time to build because theyâ€™re rigid and limiting in what can be done with them. We donâ€™t work on or build sites on those platforms because we donâ€™t believe we can make a good site with them and canâ€™t charge for something we donâ€™t believe ourselves.

Subscriptions donâ€™t own the site. If they cancel they donâ€™t keep it. Otherwise everyone would just do that and I canâ€™t stay in business. But itâ€™s custom code. What are they gonna do with it anyway? Not very many agencies code or know what to do with it. And youâ€™d have to pay them a monthly fee to maintain it anyway. So why cancel if you already like the site and service why leave?

What if eventually they want to bring an in house developer in to maintain and grow, yeah, much more, but not everybody I guess is building a 5 page site. I personally am wanting to get a web application developed, if I don't own the IP then it's not mine? You're essentially saying I have to keep paying you or you'll take away my online presence.

They will be more expensive than me. And if itâ€™s a cheap developer overseas they wonâ€™t know how to work with it very well and making new things will be a challenge for them. They will eventually ruin and break the site. Why would anyone bring in a new developer when they have the one that made it on retainer for less than 2-3 hours of salary from a hired in house developer?

Thatâ€™s the only way the business model works. It has to be indefinite. Im taking a risk too and depending on that income and client to pay it to pay my bills and support my family and do $3800 or more worth of work for $175 a month and take 2-3 years to make what I wouldâ€™ve made lump sum. My clients understand this from the beginning and I am very upfront about how it works and that they donâ€™t own it. They are fine with it because itâ€™s not just about the website. Itâ€™s about the relationship. At $175 a month they get a website and an on call developer who is the owner of the agency that they can call anytime with questions or concerns, edits, etc. itâ€™s the relationship they value. And having someone you trust that understands websites and SEO and is trustworthy and dependable is very valuable. I make a very custom product. Not many people can work on it. I take on that responsibility and manage everything for them so they can focus on their business where theyâ€™re most profitable for their time. Itâ€™s not an expense anymore. Itâ€™s an investment. They put $175 in and get much more than $175 back from it in new clientele they werenâ€™t gettin before. If they change to a new site that can go down and they can lose more more money than they save because the new website they switched to doesnâ€™t load as fast, look as professional, or is as organized and properly structured to convert. Iâ€™m valuable because I know what it takes to make a good site and make it perform and get traffic and convert. That in itself is worth the subscription for most clients and donâ€™t mind paying indefinitely for it. Maybe over 10 years they paid $20k+ for the site but my work generated more than $1million in additional sales over that period that they werenâ€™t making in the previous 10 years. Thats a hell of a return on investment. And $20k is a lot better than an $80k a year salary for a good in house developer.

Sales is the hardest. You need a unique selling point. Something you can do better than anyone else. When they ask you what you do thatâ€™s different or better, you gotta have a good answer that isnâ€™t just buzzwords and fluffy marketing terms. Framer might be tough though. All the templates Iâ€™ve seen from them are saas/tech startup or enterprise designs. Not very suitable for small businesses like restaurants or contractors. Just make sure you can adapt and deliver what the client is asking for and needs and what is expected in their industry and not just whatâ€™s available to you in the templates. The ability to customize and create with flexibility is crucial in this business. If you canâ€™t adapt to your client and their branding and market you wonâ€™t get very far!

I built the website for the people that bought it! Lol the new owner worked for Nadia and was very involved. She was ready to retire and some big shot was gonna buy it out but she gathered up as much money as she could and asked Nadia if she can buy it from her instead and she did. I gave them a huge discount in exchange for free food for me and my family. Best deal I ever made!

Can I ask you what's the process you follow for your clients? Do you gather their requirements and show them a figma design and then create the website? I resd you have a team in the comments so I'm wondering how did you design the website when you started on your own. I'm thinking of doing this but can't afford a designer, do you take inspiration from somewhere or use templates or something?

I send contract, send them questionaire from on my website to get content, design in figma, screen share to go over design and leave comments, then send it to developer to build, then preview demo link, then go live.

I can afford a designer because I take payment upfront and pay the designer with that money. You donâ€™t need one on salary. They work when thereâ€™s work. And their fee is built into my pricing and quotes.

Appreciate your response. Can I ask how you did it when starting out? Did you always hire designers even in your first month into this business? I can't ask for payment in advance in my case because I need to show them I can do something they would like first (since I'm just starting). Just looking for advice because the design part is the one I keep wondering about.

I did it myself. I wish I had a designer. Life is so much easier. Always take payment upfront. Offer returns if they are not satisfactory. Never work for free. Even when starting out. In the beginning I looked up themeforest templates and inspected their demo sites to get the code for their margins, spacing, fonts, etc and used it as a mockup and coded the design out myself in my own code. Thatâ€™s also a great way to get better at coding!

Hey Iâ€™m a c++ developer, and have recently dove into front end web development. I figured everything (html, css, js, react) out pretty quickly and about to start offering my services. Although my pricing plan is a bit different I plan to stay really affordable for small businesses as well (you can dm me if you are interested in hearing it, if not itâ€™s cool np). I have been seeing your comments on just about every webdev post, and they have been super inspiring. Anyways, I was just wondering what your tech stack is like, do you just use vanilla html, css, js, or do you use Astro, or maybe go the react (or the other similar frameworks) for a bit heavier static sites, even though it would still probably be overkill?

People who already did that and have a crappy site that doesnâ€™t do anything. Those are my most loyal clients. They know what itâ€™s like to go cheap and now that they found someone at a reasonable price that can solve all their problems with their cheap site they stay for a long time. Websites are like tattoos. You get what you pay for.

What is the exit option for your customer?

Say someone is with you for more than 2-3 years and now for whatever reason wats to go to someone else? How the website, hosting etc will move?

Also where do you host?

I am asking as I am in Canada and looking for website for my new venture. I have already secured domain name and business plan are ready. It is related to education and jobs for special needs kids in Canada. The website will need to have built in Canadian city and privacy law May not allow data to be hosted outside Canada.

They donâ€™t keep the site. I gotta keep that hard line. They keep their domain and stuff. Just not my code. If they wanna go with someone else why would they wanna keep the site? And who else would they go to? Itâ€™s a custom coded site. Most agencies and developers are Wordpress or page builder based. So keeping the site means nothing.

Any tips on how to find clients? I was laid off last week (25 years experience in software development, 15 at my previous employer) and I'm considering options to move forward.

The feeling of helplessness and self-doubt is amazing. I know there must be a way forward, but I currently can't think of anything.
