Oak Harbor Web
We Make Websites With Purpose & Intent
My name is Ryan, I am the owner and lead developer of Oak Harbor Web Designs. I got into programming after my wife had our first child. I was and still am a stay-at-home dad, and I wanted a career that I can do from home and still be there with the kids to watch them grow up. So over the course of two years I taught myself how to code websites the right way by hand and just started calling small businesses to offer my help and have been growing every year since 2019.

What I found was that a lot of small businesses don't have the funds to spend thousands of dollars upfront on a new website. And the ones that did, got taken advantage of and have a terrible website that looks like it was built by someone in a dungeon and haven't seen design trends for the last 10 years. They were in a frustrating spot - they either can't afford a good website, and if they can they don't know who to trust to make something great. So I tweaked my business model to fit their needs. That's how I came up with my $0 down and $175 a month model. It's more manageable for a small business to handle and won't hurt their bank accounts.

Our Working Process
We Take Care Of Everything
After a contract is signed we send a small questionnaire about your business and what you offer, then we expand on that content and write the entire site’s content for you, create the design, get approval, then we build. Generally takes 2-3 weeks from start to finish.

Step 1
Complete Questionnaire
We send you an email with less than 10 questions about you business, services, what sets you apart, etc and we do all the rest.

Step 2
Design Approval
We then do a video screen share showing you the first draft and make any changes you want to make sure you’re 100% satisfied.

Step 3
Development
Once approved, we can start coding the site out and setting everything up. We will send a demo link to view before we launch and go live.

Custom Code - NO Page Builders Or Wordpress
At Oak Harbor Web Designs, we do things a little differently. Instead of using page builders or Wordpress, we hand write all the code for our sites from top to bottom. This allows us to make very custom designs, have absolutely ZERO bloat or wasted code to slow us down, they load instantly, score perfect marks on Google Page Speed Insights, are more secure and actually impossible to hack, and we don't need to constantly update plugins or WordPress versions to prevent hacking.

Why IT Matters
Faster load times
Better conversions
Better performing ads
More secure
Better ranking on Google
Boosts your Google Business Profile in the Maps Listings
Better Load times leads to higher conversions
It's very competitive online, and you need every edge you can get to stand out and overtake your competition. When everyone else is using a page builder and getting poor load times, you could be getting something different - something custom coded and loading instantly. This is important because if your website takes more than 3 seconds to load, you could lose up to 50% of your traffic because they leave before the site can load. They just don't want to wait that long. Our sites load so fast they don't have any chance to leave, allowing us to capture more leads to the site than your old one did.

Better Ads Performance
The faster your website loads, the better your conversions are for the ads to send them to. And Google prefers websites that load fast. Faster loading websites actually have a lower cost-per-click which can save you hundreds or more a month depending on how much you're spending on ads clicks.

Custom Coded Websites Are More Secure
WordPress and other builders have lots of vulnerabilities and points of entry into the site that can be compromised. Like with Wordpress, if you aren't constantly updating your plugins and WordPress version then you are increasing the chances of getting hacked every day you don't. Hackers target WordPress more than any other platform because they are easier to get into (especially if you aren't doing your updates!).

With our custom code, we don't have any databases or server side requests being made that hackers can intercept and hijack to insert their own code to redirect a site to a spam site. It's just static HTML and CSS files. There's nothing TO hack. We can leave our sites alone for 10 years and nothing will happen to them. They are as secure as you can get.

Improve your search ranking
Better load times can improve your ranking on Google in a number of ways. The most common way is by just being faster. If there are two similar sites with similar content and domain authority, Google has stated that the one with the better Page Speed Scores and Core Vitals will win.

The other method is more indirect. When your site loads faster, more people reach it. And the more people you have going to your site can increase your ranking. And by focusing on Google's Core Vitals Metrics we can create a better user experience on the site to keep them on the site with higher session times and navigating the site with more clicks to other pages to learn more. With more traffic, higher session times, and better click through rates, we can improve our Google ranking by showing Google we are solving the users search queries and are experts in our field that visitors find valuable with our carefully written and helpful content.

Boost Your Google Business Profile
A faster loading website can also add extra boost to your Google Business Profile and help increase your visibility in Maps searches. Couple that with LOTS of 5 star reviews, images, and a full 100% complete profile, you will start seeing more leads coming from that profile than you had before. The more visible we can make your profile there, the more people that reach your site, and that's more people that our site can convert into a lead.

Small Business SEO Specialists
Web design and SEO go hand in hand. A well-built website will not always be enough to move the needle as much as you'd like, especially in more competitive markets. That's why we have an in-house SEO expert who knows how to rank a website and generate leads.

Forget the buzzwords like "optimize your user experience, submit a site map, optimize your meta tags and descriptions, blah blah blah". Those are all things that EVERY developer should be doing by default. Those aren't SEO services. SEO is an active and engaged process of content creation, backlinking, blogging, and monitoring. If you want to learn more about our small business SEO services, we're happy to set up a call and explain in detail every little thing we do and how this all works.

Small Business SEO Services
Search engine optimization is more challenging than ever. Whether you run a construction business here in Northwest Indiana, a law firm down in LaFayette, or have a company elsewhere in the United States, we can help. To start generating leads or sales from Google, send us a note.

Who We Can Help With SEO
Local Service Businesses
We've helped many contractors significantly scale their businesses through SEO. Foundation repair, painting, custom closets, commercial cleaning, and other business categories all need a strong presence on Google. We help your rank higher in the Google Map Pack and the traditional search engine results page (SERP), and we will be able to track keyword ranking improvements, traffic to your site, and even how many leads you are receiving from search. This makes it easy to measure ROI and invest appropriately.

B2B Companies
B2B selling involves many touchpoints, you need to add organic search to your list of priority marketing channels. Some b2b companies sell a product or service that people are already searching for online -- this makes the strategy and competitive landscape easier to picture. For instance, corporate retreat planners have an in-demand service, as do companies that sell intelligent document processing software.

But what if you solve a particular problem for companies, but they don't know your solution exists? You can certainly build awareness with top-of-funnel ads on Google, Youtube, LinkedIn, and other platforms, but SEO can be part of this strategy as well.

Through audience research, topical research, and other onboarding processes, we can often create an SEO-driven editorial strategy that will attract readers from your ideal client profile. By adding CTAs to the content, building more awareness, and using that audience for remarketing campaigns, you can start to book calls and make sales.

Education
Music schools, dance schools, art programs, and other educational institutions can significantly increase leads and enrollment through SEO. Like local service businesses, you may be missing out on 50-100 leads per month by not competing on Google search.

Other Business Types
We've worked with a huge variety of businesses across the US, and we would be happy to hear from you. From medical clinics to luxury travel companies, we've driven growth for dozens and dozens of businesses.

The SEO Strategy
The Site's Technical Foundation
Your website needs to be fast, user-friendly, and free from glaring technical errors. This is a given with a website from Oak Harbor Web Design -- our sites outperform most sites on Wordpress, Webflow, Squarespace, Wix, and other CMS platforms. Our unique method gives us an instant advantage over slower competitors.

We also crawl every site for 404 errors, canonical issues, 301 redirect chains, lack of proper heading structure, and more. We will also optimize the site's schema data, meta titles, meta descriptions, and everything else.

Content Strategy
Do you have content on your site that can be competitive on Google? We perform intensive keyword research for every new client, and this helps us know which pages we need on the site and how to write them. For local service businesses, we blanket your region with pages that can rank for terms like:

Painting company Hammond, IN

Criminal defense attorney Seattle

Physical therapy Oak Harbor

This network of pages will drive leads for your business.

If you don't offer a local service, we can write, optimize and publish nationally-competitive top-level service pages, or build out an intuitive blog strategy that will generate leads or fill your remarketing strategy.

Above all, our content strategies are based on data, executed with professional writing, and optimized to rank on Google.

Local SEO
Many of our clients receive a significant number of their leads from the Google Map Pack, thanks to excellent rankings for "near me" search terms. We will audit your Google Business Profile, fill it out with improved information, and audit your business name/address/phone information on web directories across the web. We also track your Google Map Pack rankings specifically, so that we can report on progress and adjust our strategy accordingly.

Backlinking
You need links from other websites pointing to your website. This has been the case for a long time, but Google gets increasingly picky about what it deems a "high quality link." We use our database of quality business directories, publisher relationships, and intentional outreach to land meaningful backlinks that help our clients rank better on Google.

The SEO Time Frame
If you have an established online presence, we may be able to attack some quick wins. For instance, if your website is riddled with 404 errors, has backlinks pointing to pages that no longer exist, and has 50 low quality service pages with very little content, we can often correct those issues and start increasing your lead volume in as little as three months.

However, if you are a startup in a competitive business category, it may take six months or longer. This is fine, since SEO is more of an investment rather than a quick transaction (if that's what you need, ask us about Google Ads). But you will need to prepare for months of backlink acquisition and content production before you start to see significant traffic and lead growth.

Get in Touch For More Information About Our SEO Services
We'd be happy to chat with you, provide a proposal, and point to success stories that relate to your company or business. If you have any questions about our web development, SEO, or Google Ads services, get in touch.

Our Process
We Take Care Of Everything
You can either refer your client directly to us to manage everything from start to finish as well as post-launch edits and support, or we can instead work directly with you to implement what your client needs.

Step 1
Complete Questionnaire
We send a small questionaire about the business, what they do thats unique, all the services they sell, etc. so we can get a good idea of what we want to say on the site.

Step 2
Design Approval
Once we have a design we will go over it in a screen share session before making its way to the client so we can make sure it's 100% ready for the reveal.

Step 3
Development
After making any edits from the design phase, we will begin to develop the site and all its pages. Once it's ready we will share a demo link to view before going live.

Ryan has been a fantastic partner to work with. We were making Wordpress sites but it wasn't our bread and butter and we just got burnt out from making them. We're so glad we found Ryan and his team who can make a better site in half the time and I can focus on the rest of the business. His work is among the best I've ever seen from a developer.

As an agency owner I have tried to learn to code on my own, outsource my team, and went with other "white label" companies that never delivered what they promised. I found Ryan and have not had to look at any other web development options since. I refer everyone I meet to him. Fast and clean sites with great response times from him and his team. Highly recommend him and his team.
